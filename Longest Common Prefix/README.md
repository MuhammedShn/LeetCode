# Longest Common Prefix

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 

## Example 1:

        Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
        Output: "fl"

## Example 2:

        Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
        Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
 

### Constraints:

a.1 <= strs.length <= 200
b.0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
c.strs[i] consists of only lower-case English letters.
